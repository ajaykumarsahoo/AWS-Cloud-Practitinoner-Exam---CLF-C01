- focus on the deployment and management of your applications
- You don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.
- Elastic Beanstalk is an example of a PaaS service. You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring.
Ex-
RDS, Elastic Beanstalk


c) Software as a Service (SaaS):

- SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider.
- SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. 
- AWS Rekognition is an example of a SaaS service.


19 .Characteristics of AWS Cloud:

a) Agility

In the world of cloud computing, "Agility" refers to the ability to rapidly develop, test and launch software applications that drive business growth Another way to explain "Agility" - AWS provides a massive global cloud infrastructure that allows you to quickly innovate, experiment and iterate. Instead of waiting weeks or months for hardware, you can instantly deploy new applications. This ability is called Agility.

b) Elasticity - This refers to the ability to acquire resources as you need and release when they are no longer needed is termed as Elasticity of the Cloud.

c) Reliability - This refers to the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, by dynamically acquiring computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions.

d) Scalability - Scalability is the measurement of a system's ability to grow to accommodate an increase in demand, or shrink down to a diminishing demand.


20. SQS - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.

21. SNS - Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Using Amazon SNS topics, your publisher systems can fan-out messages to a large number of subscriber endpoints for parallel processing, including Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, and HTTP/S webhooks. Additionally, SNS can be used to fan out notifications to end users using mobile push, SMS, and email.

Therefore, both SNS and SQS can be used to decouple components of a microservices-based application.

22.Lambda :
- AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 

-You pay only for the compute time you consume. 
- you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration
- Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

 
23. EC2 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud with support for per-second billing. It is the easiest way to provision servers on AWS Cloud and access the underlying OS. EC2 cannot be used to decouple components of a microservices-based application.

a) Reserved Instance :
- Reserved Instances provide you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing

- You can purchase a Reserved Instance for a one-year or three-year commitment, 
- with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount.

b) On-Demand Instance:

- An On-Demand Instance is an instance that you use on-demand. 
- You have full control over its lifecycle 
— you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. 
-There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. 
-There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. 
-The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. 
-On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. 
- However, On-demand instances are not as cost-effective as Reserved instances,
-On-Demand instances are the best fit for short-term, spiky and critical workloads.

c) Spot Instance:

- A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. 
-Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), 
-you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. 
-Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks. 
-These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time. 

d) Dedicated Host:
 - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, 
- but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. 
- An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. 
-They're not cost-efficient compared to On-Demand instances
-server-bound software licenses

-S3 Glacier Deep Archive can also be used for backup and disaster recovery use cases. 
-It has a retrieval time (first byte latency) of 12 to 48 hours.

29. AWS Shared Responsibility Model:

- Configuration Management - both customer and AWS responsibility.
- Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer.
- AWS maintains the configuration of its infrastructure devices, but a customer is responsible for configuring their own guest operating systems, databases, and applications.
- Patch Management – AWS is responsible for patching and fixing flaws within the infrastructure, but customers are responsible for patching their guest OS and applications.
- Configuration Management – AWS maintains the configuration of its infrastructure devices, but a customer is responsible for configuring their own guest operating systems, databases, and applications.
- Awareness & Training - AWS trains AWS employees, but a customer must train their own employees

Customer Specific :
------------------
– Controls which are solely the responsibility of the customer based on the application they are deploying within AWS services. Examples include:
-Service and Communications Protection or Zone Security which may require a customer to route or zone data within specific security environments

-Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service.
-Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network

31.Internet Gateway:

- An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. 
- An internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances


32. Site-to-Site VPN:
- AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates a secure connection between your data center or branch office and your AWS cloud resources. 
- This connection goes over the public internet.


33. Please review this pricing comparison for EC2 Reserved Instances:

So the percentage savings for each option is as follows:

"No upfront payment option with the standard 1-year term" - 36%

"Partial upfront payment option with the standard 1-years term" - 39%

"All upfront payment option with the standard 1-year term" - 40%

"No upfront payment option with the standard 3-years term" - 56%

"Partial upfront payment option with the standard 3-years term" - 59%

"All upfront payment option with the standard 3-years term" - 62%


Exam Alert:

For the exam, there is no need to memorize these savings numbers. 
-All you need to remember is that a 3 years term would always be more cost-effective than a 1-year term. 
-Then within a term, "all upfront" is better than "partial upfront" which in turn is better than "no upfront" from a cost savings perspective.
